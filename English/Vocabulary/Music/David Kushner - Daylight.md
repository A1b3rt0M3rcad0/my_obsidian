Letter:

Telling myself I won't go there  - Dizendo a mim mesmo eu não vou lá
Oh, but I know that I won't care  - Oh, mas sei que não vou me importar
Tryna wash away all the blood I've spilt  - Tentando lavar todo sangue que derramei
This lust is a burden that we both share  - 
Two sinners can't atone from a lone prayer  
Souls tied, intertwined by pride and guilt

(Ooh) there's darkness in the distance  
From the way that I've been livin'  
(Ooh) but I know I can't resist it

Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine  
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time  
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight  
From the daylight, runnin' from thе daylight  
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight  
Oh, I love it and I hatе it at the same time

Tellin' myself it's the last time  
Can you spare any mercy that you might find  
If I'm down on my knees again?  
Deep down, way down, Lord, I try  
Try to follow Your light, but it's nighttime  
Please don't leave me in the end

(Ooh) there's darkness in the distance  
I'm beggin' for forgiveness  
(Ooh) but I know I might resist it, oh

Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time  
You and I drink the poison from the same vine  
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time  
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight  
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight  
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight  
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time

Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time  
You and I drink the poison from the same vine  
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time  
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight  
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight  
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight  
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
