Letter:

Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real good time  - Hoje a noite, irei me divertir de verdade
I feel alive  - Eu me sinto vivo
And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah!  - E o mundo, irei virar do avesso
I'm floating around in ecstasy  - Estou flutuando em ecstasy
So don't stop me now  - Então não me pare agora
Don't stop me - Não me pare

'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time  
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky  
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity  
I'm a racing car passing by, like Lady Godiva  
I'm gonna go, go, go  
There's no stopping me  
I'm burning through the sky, yeah!  
Two hundred degrees  
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit  
I'm travelling at the speed of light  
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

Don't stop me now  
I'm having such a good time  
I'm having a ball  
Don't stop me now  
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call  
Don't stop me now ('cause I'm havin' a good time)  
Don't stop me now (yes, I'm havin' a good time)  
I don't wanna stop at all

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars  
On a collision course  
I am a satellite, I'm out of control  
I am a sex machine ready to reload  
Like an atom bomb about to  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode

I'm burning through the sky, yeah!  
Two hundred degrees  
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit  
I'm travelling at the speed of light  
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me  
Hey, hey, hey  
Don't stop me, don't stop me, ooh, ooh, ooh  
I like it  
Don't stop me, don't stop me  
Have a good time, good time  
Don't stop me, don't stop me

Ooh, I'm burning through the sky, yeah!  
Two hundred degrees  
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit  
I'm travelling at the speed of light  
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

Don't stop me now  
I'm having such a good time  
I'm having a ball  
Don't stop me now  
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call  
Don't stop me now ('cause I'm havin' a good time)  
Don't stop me now (yes, I'm havin' a good time)  
I don't wanna stop at all
